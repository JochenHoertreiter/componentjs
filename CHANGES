    Changes
    =======

    This is a list of MAJOR changes to ComponentJS. For a
    more fine-granular commit-based change information,
    have a look at the version control history under
    https://github.com/rse/componentjs/commits/master

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.0.1 and 1.0.2
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Cherry-picked and back-ported all major bugfixes from the
      ComponentJS development branch.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 1.0.0 and 1.0.1
    -------------------------------------------------

    o add an "enabled" state on top of visible for those
      situations where we want to show a UI but still keep it disabled.

    o correctly tear down the component tree in shutdown()
      as the root component cannot be directly destroyed.

    o fix syntax of TypeScript type definition file "component.d.ts".

    o document "clazz" behavior better in the API documentation.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.9 and 1.0.0
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Removed the "async" option on register() as it never worked
      and was a wrong design idea anyway.

    o On publishing events the "spreading" option no longer defaults to
      "true" in order to improve performance in standard cases.

    o Improve build process: provide a "stage0" target which does not
      need any special tools beside "perl" and "shtool" in order to allow
      developers under Windows to participate more easily.

    o Added "targeting" (boolean) option to plug() / unplug() and this
      way indirectly fix the semantic of link() in case a target should
      link onto itself.

    o Added "scope" (string) option to property() to allow a more
      convenient way to scope a property instead of the special
      "name@scope" syntax of the "name" option.

    o In the debugger, prepend log messages instead of appending them
      as this is a lot more convenient during debugging.

    o Added necessary hooks for companion project "componentjs-tracing",
      to allow easier instrumentation of ComponentJS based applications.

    o Improved and updated TypeScript definition for newer TypeScript
      0.9 world order (where "bool" is not "boolean", etc).

    o Skip not-enumerable fields and the special fields "constructor"
      and "prototype" on object/hash validation.

    o Fixed internal cloning of Array objects (which is
      used for the "dynamics" part of cs.clazz!).

    o Improve the internal JSON encoder to more correctly detect cycles.

    o Allow also "null" as an identifier to validate against the special
      Object null.

    o Allow application to still enforce standard sockets by skipping
      the jQuery/ExtJS inference if no 'type' parameter is given.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.8 and 0.9.9
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Switch code-base to latest JSHint.

    o Improve API documentation.

    o Reduced the external build-time dependencies.

    o Bugfix cs.params() function and add additional hook
      for plugins to cs.params().

    o Provide "this.result" (the current aggregated result)
      and "this.hooks" (the total number of registered hooks)
      to the internal hooking mechanism to allow plugins to
      leverage from more information.

    o Reduce the number of redundant internal annotation calls
      in the central clazz/trait mechanism.

    o Cleanup all internal "cs.params()" usages by using either
      "req" or "def" but never both in parallel (as it makes no sense).

    o Allow all "spool" parameters to use the syntax
      "<comp-path>:<spool-name>" in addition to the standard
      "<spool-name>" in order to use the spool of component, addressed
      via the relative path "<comp-path>".

    o Sockets created with socket()/link() can be no destroyed
      with unsocket()/unlink()

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.7 and 0.9.8
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Improved Debugger plugin: the components in the component tree
      view are now clickable. Once clicked details about the component
      are displayed in the new infobox view which overlays the console
      view. Additionally, the component tree view now provides a zoom
      and scroll functionality in order to allow you to display large
      component trees in a reasonable way, too.

    o Modularized the debugger plugin sources.

    o The localStorage persistence functionality of models is now
      in a dedicated plugin (component.plugin.localstorage.js) because
      the localStorage functionality is not available everywhere
      (e.g. not in NodeJS head-less testing situations, etc).

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.6 and 0.9.7
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Fixed internal "clazz" parameter validation.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.5 and 0.9.6
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Improved Debugger plugin: the status bar is now grabbable
      to allow you to more precisely control the size of the component
      tree visual display. The background of the visual display, header
      and status bar are now gradient based. Active state transition
      guards are now indicated by partially-overlayed red light bulps
      (rendered only if guards are not at level 0).

    o <component>.subscribe({ origin: true, ... }) functionality was
      removed as the Event object on callbacks has the origin via its
      <ev>.target() method.

    o fixed "exclusive" subcription handling.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.4 and 0.9.5
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Replaced the object validation mechanism of cs.params() and
      cs.model() with a full-blown DSL-based implementation. The most
      notably changes are that a "null" value now matches the type
      "object". Upgrade your source: "array(foo)" is now "[foo*]"

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.3 and 0.9.4
    -------------------------------------------------

    o The 4th argument (DOCUMENT) for ComponentJS.plugin() is now gone.
      Plugins should not need it anyway.

    o Additional internal hooks are provided for plugins.

    o Model default values are initially validated, too.

    o The <script data-symbol="<name>" [...]> functionalit
      was removed as it conflicts with the plugin mechanism.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.2 and 0.9.3
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Refactored out the debugger into its own plugin.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.1 and 0.9.2
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Added back support for Internet Explorer 8 where a field
      cannot be named "constructor". The cs.clazz/cs.trait field
      is now named "cons".

    o Added an additional "configured" state which can be used
      to configure subscribe/register/observe/latch operations
      while "prepare" is still intended for loading data.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.9.0 and 0.9.1
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Implemented an internal hooking and plugin mechanism and
      provided two convenient plugins for jQuery and Ext socket support.

    Major changes between ComponentJS 0.0.0 and 0.9.0
    -------------------------------------------------

    o Initial functionality
